# note-taker

Takes notes with a backend. Experience the live site at [Heroku](https://note-taker-29587.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation

First, download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, make a copy of my repo locally.

Lastly, you need to run npm install in order to download the dependencies required.

```
npm install
```

NOTE: Because I have saved the dependencies to package.json and my git repo, you may not need to install anything besides node and the packages.

## Usage

Once you have my repo locally, simply navigate to the folder in your terminal.

Then, just run the program in node.

```
node server.js
```

This will run the app locally, where you can experiment. In your browser, you will need to go to localhost:3000.

## Credits

Folder system and some code given by my bootcamp.

Thanks to Akhil (my bootcamp instructor) for teaching me all this stuff!

In my project I use express. Couldn't have done it without them!
